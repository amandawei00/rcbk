Hi! Here you'll find my solution to the BK evolution equation.
You can find the BK equation in eq. 1 of this paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1001.1378.pdf

Contents:
	- bk_solver.py: Contains the important parts of the BK solution
	- solver.pyx  : Contains parts of the BK solution I wrote in Cython for speed
	- solver.pxd  : Header file for solver.pyx required to call LowLevelCallable in bk_solver.py
	- spline_c.c  : Cubic spline interpolator I translated to C from FORTRAN, originally written by J.L. Albacete
	- setup.py    : Script to compile and package solver.pyx for use in bk_solver
	- solver, solver.html: files generated by setup.py during compilation
        - More reference papers I used can be found in the papers folder
